# Intro to data science

* **Lectures**: Wednesdays 13:15--16:00 (21.09.2022--14.12.2022)
* **Location**: RS40 - [Faculty of Arts](https://goo.gl/maps/ufPzXmoxHDXrbPrx6)
* **ECTS credits**: 3
* **Instructor**: [Dr. Steven Moran](https://www.unine.ch/evolang/home/team/steven-moran.html) \<steven.moran@unine.ch\>
* **Office**: Rue Emile-Argand 11, G B35
* **Office hours**: By appointment via email

**Course summary**: The basic principles and methods of [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) will be presented. A central theme is the assessment of scientific claims, and subsequent data collection, transformation, quantitative analysis, and reporting of scientific results. Official course description:

* http://www10.unine.ch/desc_data/plans2022-2023/plan_2022-2023_2LN2319.pdf

**Form of assessment**: Continuous assessment with data science exercises (graded). Work not submitted by the required deadline will result in a fail for that given assessment.

**Form of education**: Readings, lectures, methods and [data practical](data_practical.md) (final project).

The course schedule is available here (invite only; email me if don't have access):

* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpLh_zcx-XNne84IaXbYCqIAp6T17wkEaEK7OUVtEhQ/edit#gid=0

**Course structure**: The readings will include chapters from: Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World, by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West: 

* https://www.callingbullshit.org

Please practice [critical reading](https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/critical_reading.pdf). Here is a nice example of [reading a technical paper](https://jofrhwld.github.io/teaching/courses/2022_lin517/reading/). 

***

We will begin each class with a presentation by student(s) followed by a discussion of the reading. The presentation should be a short summary of the chapter (~10-15 minutes max!), in your own thoughts, in PowerPoint or similar program, or as you prefer. Everyone else should read the material before class and bring their opinions, criticisms, and questions about the reading.

***

Lectures will be given in class and they will be followed by practical in-class work. The contents of each lecture, and more, is available in each folder in this repository, e.g., to get started go to lecture materials in [week one](1_introduction).

***

Homework involves courses from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). The suggested due date is before the next lecture. (The aim is to keep you on track, so that you don't fall behind. :)  All homework assignments must be completed by the last day of class.

***

The "final" [data practical](data_practical.md) will include the creation of an R markdown [scientific report](2_scientific_reports) incorporating material and methods from the lectures in R code. You will select dataset(s) of your own interest to test a hypothesis (or hypotheses) of your choosing and then tell a story (we will discuss various examples). 

This report must be [compiled (aka knit)](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/2_writing_scientific_reports#r-markdown-overview) into one of the following formats for final submission:

* GitHub markdown in a GitHub repository (preferred -- we will discuss this procedure in class)
* HTML
* PDF

On the final day of class, each student will briefly present their [data practical](data_practical.md) report and we will anonymously rate and review them.

If you use GitHub, put your repository's URL into the spreadsheet in the course schedule above. If you do not use GitHub, please submit your [data practical](data_practical.md) to me via email.

The course is heavily weighted on the [data practical](data_practical.md). The idea is that you not only learn how to implement the materials you learn from DataCamp and from this course, but that after the course is over, you will have a piece of work that showcases your data science skills, e.g., something that you can share on a resume or CV or on job or school applications.

***

**Grading**: 

* 70% [data practical](data_practical.md).

* 30% of your grade will come from the presentation of the reading chapters (to be divided among the students). 

* Homework in DataCamp is pass / fail. That is, you must complete all homework assignments to pass the class. You will be added to our DataCamp group and you should receive an invite. DataCamp requires a login. (Shout out to DataCamp for giving us free access to their great materials.)

**Note**: This syllabus is subject to change but the most up-to-date version is always available online:

* https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience

To get started with this course, follow the instructions in:

* [1_introduction](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/1_introduction)

Then follow the chapters as per the class as per the [class schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpLh_zcx-XNne84IaXbYCqIAp6T17wkEaEK7OUVtEhQ/edit?usp=sharing).

An important note about the chapters in this class. We aim to provide a lot of information on each topic -- sometimes much more than you will have time to read or go through, for example, multiple different readings and tutorials on the same topic. This often appears in bullet points where we give multiple resources on the same topic.

This highlights an important learning point of this course:

**Read what you need**.

***

A note on learning how to code. If you have no experience, it will likely be a steep learning curve. Search engines are your friend. If you encounter an error, try searching on that error -- almost always, someone else has already encountered and solved your problem!

Don't struggle for hours on the same problem -- reach out if needed. Either to a forum (e.g., [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) is a popular place for coding questions) or to your instructor. 

**But in either case make sure you provide a reproducible example!** For example:

* http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example

The code and the data needed to reproduce the error or problem.

***

Lastly, every classroom has students with different levels of experience. The goal is that you understand and can implement the learning objectives in this course. It is not the goal that you go through every single URL provided in each chapter in detail. But of course read what interests you!

**Good luck and have fun!!!**
